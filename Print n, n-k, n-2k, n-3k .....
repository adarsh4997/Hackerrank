You will be given two integers N and K as an integer input.

You have to print the series N, N-K, N-2K where each number should be printed in a separate line and you have to print till the time the printed integer is greater than or equal to zero.

Kindly take a look at the sample test cases for a better understanding.

Input Format

For each test case,

N will be given as an integer input in the first line,

K will be given as an integer input in the second line.

Constraints

0 <= N , K <= 2^31-1
Output Format

Print the numbers as integer outputs in the separate line.
